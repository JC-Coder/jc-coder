## About Me

I'm a results-oriented backend engineer with a focus on building scalable, secure, and high-performance APIs and microservices. My expertise lies in Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and Nest.js, and I thrive on architecting robust server-side solutions that power real-world applications.

I love collaborating on open-source projects, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the developer community. My work is driven by a commitment to clean code, best practices, and continuous learning in software architecture and cloud technologies.
