## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a knack for turning complex systems into seamless solutions. From mission-critical infrastructure to lightning-fast APIs, I specialize in building scalable, resilient, and production-ready applications that just work—even at scale.

I've handled (and am still handling) **20+ servers**, powering **apps with 40,000+ users**, managing **high-load backends**, building **Telegram bots**, deploying **Web3 applications**, and ensuring uptime under pressure.

I thrive on:

* Building clean and testable APIs
* Architecting applications that scale
* Owning DevOps pipelines like second nature
* Supporting developers and helping teams ship faster
* Making backend code elegant, not just functional

Whether it’s open source or production-grade SaaS, I bring precision, reliability, and that extra fire that makes things click.
